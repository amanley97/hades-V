# Microcontroller Design, Lab: HaDes-V

***Ever thought about developing a processor from scratch and bringing it to life on an FPGA? With HaDes-V, you'll delve into hardware design and create your own pipelined 32-bit RISC-V processor, mastering efficient computing principles and practical FPGA implementation.***

The [Instruction Guide][instrguide] and this source code template for the [**Microcontroller Design, Lab**][lvref] is an **Open Educational Resource (OER)** developed by [Tobias Scheipel](https://www.scheipel.com), David Beikircher, and Florian Riedl, Embedded Architectures & Systems Group at Graz University of Technology. It is designed for teaching and learning microcontroller design and hardware description languages, using the **HaDes-V architecture**, a RISC-V-based processor.

## Project Overview

The lab is structured around designing, simulating, and synthesizing the HaDes-V processor. It integrates software and hardware design exercises using SystemVerilog, assembly, and C.

One of the standout features of HaDes-V is its **modular design**:  
- Implement each module of the pipeline individually in the [`rtl/`](rtl) directory and cross-check its functionality using pre-compiled Verilator libraries provided in [`ref/`](ref).  
- Validate that your implementation fits seamlessly into the overall processor—just like solving a jigsaw puzzle.  
- Focus on one stage at a time, integrate step-by-step, and build confidence as you progress.  

Key topics covered:
- **RISC-V Architecture**: Hands-on implementation of a pipelined processor with custom extensions.
- **FPGA Development**: Using the AMD [Vivado][vivado] toolchain and the [Basys3][basys] development board.
- **Hardware/Software Co-design**: Combining hardware description and software programming skills.

## Why HaDes-V?

- **Learn by Building**: Design a pipelined RISC-V processor from scratch.
- **Modular Design**: Implement, test, and integrate each module of the pipeline step by step—just like solving a jigsaw puzzle.
- **Immediate Validation**: Use golden references in [`ref/`](ref) to ensure your functionality matches expectations.
- **Hands-On Debugging**: Simulate and verify your work with tools like [Verilator][verilator] and [GTKWave][gtkwave].
- **Real Hardware Integration**: Bring your design to life on an FPGA using the [Basys3][basys]  board.

## Learning Outcomes  
By completing the lab, students will:  
- **Design** a modular, pipelined 32-bit RISC-V processor with multiple stages.  
- **Implement** CPU functionality using SystemVerilog.  
- **Program** software for the processor in RISC-V Assembly and C.  
- **Deploy** the processor design onto FPGA boards.  
- **Analyze** the processor using simulation and waveform tools.

## Tools and Dependencies

The following tools are required for the lab exercises (details in the [Instruction Guide][instrguide]):
- **[SystemVerilog][sv]**: HDL for processor and peripheral design.
- **[RISC-V Toolchain][rvgcc]**: Compiler for RV32I assembly and C programs.
- **[Vivado][vivado]**: FPGA synthesis and programming.
- **[Verilator][verilator]**: Open-source HDL simulator.
- **[GTKWave][gtkwave]**: Waveform viewer for debugging simulations.

## Repository Structure

- [`defines/`](defines): HDL constants and definitions.
- [`lib/`](lib): Peripheral modules (e.g., UART, timer).
- [`ref/`](ref): Precompiled reference libraries.
- [`rtl/`](rtl): The actual student implementation. Contains code stubs for further development.
- [`synth/`](synth): Synthesis scripts and FPGA configuration files.
- [`test/`](test): Test files in assembly (`asm`), C (`c`), and SystemVerilog (`sv`).
- [`.vscode/`](.vscode): Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

Refer to the [Instruction Guide][instrguide] for a detailed project structure.

## Exercises

The laboratory includes several exercises to progressively build the HaDes-V processor:
- **Basic Implementation**: CPU module, instruction fetch, decode, and execution stages.
- **Advanced Features**: Memory stage, writeback stage, and control/status registers.
- **Extensions**: Final project to extend the processor with custom peripherals or functionality.

Each exercise allows you to implement and test individual modules while leveraging the **golden references** in [`ref/`](ref) for validation—ensuring seamless integration like solving a puzzle.

See the detailed exercise instructions in Chapter 4 of the [Instruction Guide][instrguide].
